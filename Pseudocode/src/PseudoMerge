Begin program

mergeSort( take array, start and end as parameters) {
pick middle index
recursively call mergeSort method on left side from start to middle (Inclusive)
recursively call mergeSort method on right side from middle + 1 to end
merge(take start, middle and end as parameters)
}

merge (take array, start, middle, end as parameters) {
create left half array
create right half array

array copy from left half original into left half
array copy from right half original into right half

create pointers i = 0, j = 0, k = start;

if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
swap the two elements
increment i++
increment j++
}
k++
